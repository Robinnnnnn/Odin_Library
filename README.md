# Odin_Library

Functionality

-Add and remove books from Library.
-Change the description by toggling different read status's

Technologies:

-Flexbox. Super basic utilization, I just wanted to try it on a project because I typically use CSS grid.
-Object constructors and prototypes.
-CSS Linear Gradient

Note:

- I've copied the same code multiple times in here. I could def use some refactoring and have some functions that are way to long. I could split them up into smaller functions.
- No database to store data so on refresh all books dissapear.

Future Tasks:
-Refactor
-Redesign layout (library on the right, input field stationary on the left). Right side scrolls on its own. Flex-box maintains style.

- Add a database to store the data.
